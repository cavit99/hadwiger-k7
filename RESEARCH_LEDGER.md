# $HC_7$ research ledger

**Last updated:** 27 July 2026
**Authoritative status:** $HC_7$ is not proved here.
**Publication assessment:** the internally audited corpus is a credible
partial-results manuscript candidate, but it is not submission-ready;
novelty, priority, and proof correctness still require conventional
literature review and independent human validation.
**Current programme mode:** intensive autonomous proof search is paused at
tag `mathematical-freeze-2026-07-27`.  The current phase is the
[external-review and manuscript blueprint](active/hc7_partial_results_external_review_blueprint.md),
not preparation of a complete manuscript.  The primary open theorem remains
the mathematical proof spine and has not been retracted.

This is the sole authority for the current status of the project. Exact
theorem statements and proofs live in the linked frontier and result files;
historical programme snapshots are archived rather than appended here.

## Current frontier at a glance

### 1. Exhaustive global obligation

Let `G` be a hypothetical minor-minimal counterexample to `HC_7`. The
[audited low-degree reduction](results/hc7_low_degree_adjacent_pair_alignment.md)
and the
[component-uniform strengthening](results/hc7_component_uniform_boundary_alignment.md)
give a vertex `u` with `7<=d_G(u)<=9` such that every component `C` of
`G-N[u]` has a vertex

\[
 z_C\in S:=N_G(C)\subseteq N(u),
 \qquad \chi(G-\{u,z_C\})=6.
\]

For any selected `C`,

\[
 7\le |S|\le d_G(u)\le9.
\]

The pair

\[
 A=G[C\cup S],\qquad B=G-C
\]

is an actual separation with nonempty open sides. The connected set `C`
and the singleton `{u}` are each adjacent to every vertex of `S`, and
$\chi(G[S])\le4$. For every nonempty independent set `I` of `G[S]`, each
closed shore separately has a six-colouring in which `I` is exactly one
boundary colour class. These two colourings need not induce the same
partition on `S-I`.

At the same low-degree vertex, the audited component upper bounds give

\[
 \#\operatorname{comp}(G-N[u])\le
 \begin{cases}
 1,&d_G(u)=7,\\
 2,&d_G(u)=8,\\
 3,&d_G(u)=9.
 \end{cases}
\]

Thus the multi-component branch is globally bounded before any local path
taxonomy is attempted.

The exhaustive case map stops at the following
[pole-free bridge-composition theorem](active/hc7_bounded_interface_synchronization_frontier.md#4-primary-open-theorem).
The operation-specific paths forced by failed exact-block Kempe lifts must
produce at least one of:

1. an explicit `K_7`-minor model in `G`;
2. one complete equality partition of `S` induced by six-colourings of both
   closed shores; or
3. another full bounded-interface instance in the same graph on a strictly
   smaller literal anti-neighbourhood component, using that component's own
   named edge-deletion response.

This theorem is unproved. Relative to the audited entry reduction, it is
sufficient for `HC_7` and is the sole exhaustive all-degree obligation.

### 2. Degree-seven structural refinement

When `d_G(u)=7`, the boundary is `S=N(u)` and the exterior `G-N[u]` is
connected. Audited reductions give an exact matching description of the
boundary colourings and a boundary-labelled model of `K_7` with either one
missing edge or two adjacent missing edges.

The [generic exact-seven restart](results/hc7_generic_exact7_response_restart.md)
reduces this branch to a minimum-order selected-response interface. The
[degree-seven frontier](active/hc7_degree7_model_separator_frontier.md#generic-exact-seven-restart-and-the-remaining-terminal-theorem)
asks for the same three terminal outcomes—an explicit `K_7` model, one
common complete boundary partition, or a strictly smaller same-host
interface—in each of the remaining singleton, positive-separator-excess,
and shore-filling modes. This is a sharper conditional laboratory, not an
exhaustive replacement for the global obligation above.

The audited
[degree-seven tight-pole localization](results/hc7_degree7_tight_pole_edge_localization.md)
removes the pole itself as a transition-selection mystery.  In two
vertex-disjoint matching layers, each selected bichromatic component either
has two internally vertex-disjoint root-to-root routes or an internal
articulation with a connected side strictly smaller than the original
exterior.  Boundary order seven on that side is a strict generic restart;
otherwise its boundary has order at least eight.  A separating-edge witness
additionally retains the exact named matching response.  In the doubled-
route subcase, the
[route-cycle response theorem](results/hc7_degree7_route_cycle_model_persistence.md)
now identifies the exact next obstruction.  A minimal root-separating edge
bond always has a simultaneous response with the prescribed boundary pairs;
either a minimal aligned subset is one nonseparating edge, or it has at
least two edges and every single-edge response at an edge of that subset
omits `e_0` or `e_i`.  Relative to the fixed rooted `K_5`, a route-cycle
edge may preserve the same labelled model while still returning the wrong
matching; if no cycle edge preserves it, one layer reduces to a literal
`C_3`, `C_4` or `C_5` of bridge sectors joined by unique bag contacts.
Even an aligned persistent response does not identify palette colours with
bag labels.  This is a genuine narrowing rather than a proof of the
degree-seven branch.

One particularly reusable input is the
[exact-seven full-connected-subgraph packing theorem](results/hc7_exact_seven_packet_packing.md).
If `nu_i` is the maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint connected
subgraphs in open shore `i` that are adjacent to every boundary vertex,
then

\[
 \nu_1+\nu_2\le4,
 \qquad \min\{\nu_1,\nu_2\}=1,
 \qquad \omega(G[S])\le6-(\nu_1+\nu_2).
\]

Thus the packing vector is, up to orientation, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, or
`(1,3)`. The theorem combines an explicit clique-minor construction with
independent-block contraction and colour gluing. It does **not** supply a
small transversal, an apex pair, or a common boundary partition in the
remaining cases.

### 3. Immediate global terminal-decoder laboratory

The audited
[last-pole normal form](results/hc7_bounded_interface_pole_move_normal_form.md)
proves that a shortest exact-block transition has a pole-free last path
unless it ends in one precise six-block-to-five-block move: a singleton
merges into a nonsingleton independent block, and after deleting `u` its
two-colour component cannot reach another boundary vertex in any final
opposite-shore extension.

The audited
[two-transition theorem](results/hc7_bounded_interface_two_transition_disjoint_response.md)
then bypasses the former same-transition and endpoint-family bottleneck.
The endpoint nonedge `e` of a first failed lift in `C` is used as the exact
block for a second transition.  Unless a common boundary partition, the
strict smaller-component restart, or the tight pole residue occurs,
this gives vertex-disjoint paths in opposite open shores with disjoint
boundary nonedges `e,f`.  Moreover,

\[
                         K_6\not\preccurlyeq G[S]+e+f,
\]

because a `K_6` model in the augmented boundary would lift through the two
paths and join the singleton `{u}` to form an explicit `K_7` model.  The two
paths may come from different colouring operations; this is no obstacle to
the proved literal path construction, but compatible paths remain
nonterminal.

The earlier audited endpoint-pair and robust-independent-triple theorems
remain valid supporting results, but they are no longer direct inputs to the
live reduction.  The exact remaining
[terminal decoder](active/hc7_bounded_interface_synchronization_frontier.md#7-immediate-terminal-decoder)
must close the connected-exterior `K_6`-minor-free augmented-boundary path
case or tight pole case by an explicit `K_7` model, one common complete
boundary partition, or the exact strict component restart.  The
multi-component branch now has the separate audited preprocessing below.

The audited
[component-deletion exchange theorem](results/hc7_component_deletion_kempe_exchange.md)
supersedes the failed equal-order reinterpretation attempt whenever
`G-N[u]` has at least two components.  The common neighbourhood is
four-degenerate, every exterior component has a private rejected boundary
colouring, and one supported nonedge can be chosen through every component
simultaneously.  Adding all those nonedges to `G[N(u)]` remains
`K_6`-minor-free.  The rejection map then gives either one boundary trace
rejected by at least two literal components or one Kempe interchange whose
unique rejector switches between two components.

In the singleton-rejection branch, the audited
[full-component common-root theorem](results/hc7_full_exterior_component_common_root_exchange.md)
gives a sharper dichotomy.  A non-full component returns a separator of
strictly lower boundary order, though not necessarily smaller component
order.  If every component is full to `N(u)`, there are exactly two; their
failed lifts share one literal root `x`, `chi(G-x)=6`, and completion by
`{x}` is reduced to a `K_6` model in `G-x` whose six bags all meet `N(x)`.
The known `HC_6` supplies only an unrooted model.  This is a genuine rooted
completion problem, not a solved terminal step.

The audited
[common-root flip-cube theorem](results/hc7_common_root_flip_cube_fork.md)
now adds a synchronized invariant inside that exact residue.  The spliced
six-colouring has exclusive opposite-side contacts in the two exchanged
colours, and criticality forces an induced odd cycle through `x` whose
remaining path crosses between the two literal exterior components.
Complement symmetry of the rejection map on the two-colour flip cube forces
one boundary colouring with rejector-changing moves in two distinct
coordinates.  In one fixed accepted extension, the two operated boundary
components therefore lie either in one common two-colour component or in
two disjoint two-colour components supporting two disjoint paths.  One path
through the opposite exterior component yields either three distinct
supported nonedges or a bilateral realization of one nonedge together with
the other fixed-extension path.  The corresponding two- or three-edge
augmentation remains `K_6`-minor-free.

The separately audited
[alternating trace-cycle theorem](results/hc7_common_root_alternating_trace_cycle.md)
turns each rejector-changing coordinate into one coherent cyclic object.
Fix an accepted extension on each shore, one before and one after the
boundary switch.  Their full two-colour components define two partitions of
the boundary two-colour components.  The independently switchable block
unions are linear subspaces over `F_2`.  These two switch spaces cannot meet
after translation by the operated coordinate, because an intersection would
give the same labelled boundary colouring on both shores and six-colour
`G`.  In the bipartite block-intersection multigraph, the operated coordinate
is therefore not a bridge and lies on a cycle.  A two-edge cycle is one
bilateral pair of full trace components; a longer cycle is an alternating
sequence of literal full two-colour components from the two fixed shore
extensions.  Same-shore members are disjoint and anticomplete, and a shortest
cycle controls every nonconsecutive overlap.

The new separately audited
[short-trace classification](results/hc7_common_root_short_trace_classification.md)
spends the sharp neighbourhood independence bound on this cycle.  There are
at most three boundary two-colour components in degree eight and at most
four in degree nine.  Hence every shortest trace cycle is bilateral, except
for one possible exact four-cycle in degree nine.  At the synchronized fork,
degree eight always puts the two operated traces in one common component of
the fixed accepted extension; the residual is either a bilateral pair or an
atomic three-trace configuration.  The fork may be chosen so that one of
those traces is the original singleton root `{x}`.  In degree nine, two
distinct fixed components force an exact `2+2` partition, and each
opposite-shore response is either bilateral or a transverse four-cycle.  In
the four-cycle case all four traces are `K_1` or `K_2`; the literal shore
paths form an odd cycle with two crossing same-shore connectors, giving an
`N(u)`-meeting `K_4` model and hence a `K_5` model after adding `{u}`.

The separately audited
[parallel-cycle normalization](results/hc7_common_root_parallel_two_cycle_normalization.md)
now compresses the dirty-path ambiguity inside every bilateral trace pair.
Choosing the partner and the two fixed-extension connectors lexicographically
gives one literal odd cycle using both shores.  Its open-shore sectors are
induced and pairwise anticomplete; there are at most three in degree eight
and four in degree nine.  Thus one degree-eight connector is boundary-clean,
and the root-retaining choice makes the cycle contain the literal common
root `x`.

The separately audited
[degree-eight boundary classification](results/hc7_degree8_nonedge_bipartition_classification.md)
now removes the static alignment ambiguity in that degree.  Every admissible
eight-vertex common-root boundary either is the single odd wheel
`K_1 vee C_7`, or has a nonedge `pq` whose deletion leaves two independent
triples `I,T`, with all required root contacts.

In the non-wheel case, the separately audited
[aligned bilateral response-cycle theorem](results/hc7_degree8_aligned_pair_bilateral_cycle.md)
couples this pair to the colouring operations.  The two exact `I,T`
responses have opposite equality types on `p,q`; one singleton boundary
interchange therefore fails in both directions and gives boundary-clean
`p`--`q` paths in the two literal shores.  Together they form an odd cycle
with one fixed operation provenance.  In either shore its full two-colour
component has a separating bridge, yielding an aligned one-edge
deletion/contraction response, or has two edge-disjoint `p`--`q` routes.

A carrier disjoint from either aligned path for either independent triple
would six-colour `G`.  Thus every surviving non-wheel instance has four
incidence splits: both `I` and `T` split after deleting the path interior in
each shore.

The separately audited
[two-defect component closure](results/hc7_degree8_two_defect_component_closure.md)
now makes this quantitative.  Every literal `p`--`q` connector meets every
carrier for either independent triple, so each carrier is a root separator.
In one shore, all residual components missing exactly two boundary vertices
miss the same one vertex of `I` and the same one vertex of `T`.  The finite
four-anchor allocation is now stronger than that application: for every one
of the `185` compact order-eight boundaries, including the odd wheel, and
every ordered pair of arbitrary boundary-defect sets of order at most two,
it returns an explicit `K_7`-minor certificate.  All `253,265` instances
pass.  In particular, two two-defect components in each aligned shore give
an explicit `K_7`-minor model.  Hence a surviving counterexample has an
oriented shore with at most one two-defect residual component; every other
residual component there misses at least three boundary vertices.

This is a terminal closure of a real subcase, not a finite-size heuristic.
It does not bound path attachments or turn a post-path residual component
into a component of `G-N[u]`.  Explicit barriers show that the cycle and four
incidence splits alone may fill both shores, while seven-connectivity plus
the named local responses can still retain arbitrarily long attachment data
when `K_7`-minor exclusion is omitted.  The separately audited
[four-portal reduction](results/hc7_degree8_four_portal_reduction.md) now
performs the next non-wheel composition.  Applying the five-terminal
two--three linkage theorem to each shore and each of `I,T`, universal
entanglement forbids its positive packing.  What remains is a fresh
exact-seven response, a shore of order at most six, a strict order-eight
lobe, or four selected (possibly repeated) confined positive-excess lobes.
Each lobe lies behind at most five internal vertices, has boundary order
between nine and thirteen, misses at most four old boundary vertices,
retains its shore and completed-cut terminal form, and has a full-separator
edge-deletion response incompatible with the fixed aligned shore colouring.
Global minimum-boundary normalization then gives either an exact-seven
response or a boundary of order eight through thirteen with exactly two or
three boundary-full components, the universal contraction profile, and
operation-specific mutually exclusive response partitions.

The block label is not always structural.  The audited
[portal role-erasure barrier](barriers/hc7_degree8_portal_role_erasure_barrier.md)
shows that the `I`- and `T`-applications can return the identical
terminal-free lobe while preserving the compact boundary, bilateral path,
four incidence splits and universal entanglement.  The audited
[independent-defect barrier](barriers/hc7_degree8_independent_two_defect_four_bag_barrier.md)
also proves that allowing the two bags in one shore to miss different
two-sets is insufficient.  Thus the former plan of independently minimizing
two tagged lobes was not justified.

The primary next theorem is the block-blind minimum-boundary
response-coupling case, beginning with an order-eight boundary and exactly
two full components.  It must produce an explicit `K_7` model, one common
complete boundary partition, or an exact-seven response on a strictly
smaller literal connected shore.

The audited arbitrary-edge response construction and its dual-free-root
refinement now give the right local object without changing colouring
quantifiers.  For one fixed edge `e` and one fixed six-colouring of `G-e`,
they retain two adjacent roots, eight latent boundary-labelled columns, one
target, five operation-specific sources and all five same-colouring
source-to-target paths.  Consuming either of the two nonresponse columns
gives a seven-column contact graph.  The newly audited
[dual-root contact-overlap theorem](results/hc7_order8_dual_root_contact_overlap_closure.md)
shows that the two choices cannot both be pentagonal bipyramids: their common
eight-column graph would already yield an explicit `K_7`-minor model.
Therefore one root choice has a column of contact degree at most three.

The exact surviving laboratory is the
[low-degree response-column frontier](active/hc7_order8_low_degree_response_column_frontier.md).
The low-degree column need not initially carry a response label.  The
audited six-vertex rooted-minor lemma shows that when the target contacts all
five sources, a response source has contact degree at most three.  The
written unified incident-pair theorem now removes the former split between
this case and an exposed source--target noncontact.  In every survivor, two
noncontacting response columns are represented by two literal edges incident
with the same vertex.  Their common deletion has the exact signature table
`(=,not equal)`, `(not equal,=)`, `(=,=)` and gives either universal
bichromatic saturation or one dirty bypass with two coupled one-edge
responses.

Two further written deductions make the host geometry sharper.  An
eight-latent-column contact/coverage maximum spans `G` outside the two fixed
fan centres, and changing the consumed nonresponse label converts every
first root hit except the opposite centre into a latent-column hit.  More
substantively, the common two-edge deletion is six-connected unless the
operated vertex has degree exactly seven; in that exception its singleton
shore is already a strict generic exact-seven response restart.  Thus every
nonrecursive dirty bypass now lives in one six-connected common deletion.
Every root-first encounter reduces to a latent-column encounter unless the
named bypass uses the single opposite fan centre.  Six-connectivity then
supplies a centre-free path, but not one retaining the named switch
provenance.
The separately audited
[incident-bypass conflict theorem](results/hc7_order8_incident_bypass_conflict_split.md)
now removes the remaining path-level ambiguity.  Whether or not the two
named bichromatic components intersect, their coupled switches isolate one
nonempty bipartite conflict edge set `F`.  The conflict deletion `G-F`
realizes the all-edge signature, full minor-criticality realizes every
singleton signature and forbids the empty signature.  Every singleton response is
locked in all five alternate colours; unit edges on opposite shores with
one boundary partition would already glue.  One induced conflict
component splits into two adjacent connected sides which both see all five
alternate colours in the same colouring.  The accompanying
[compression barrier](barriers/hc7_incident_bypass_conflict_compression_barrier.md)
shows that shortestness and central-colouring Kempe normalization alone
cannot simplify `F`: every nonempty bipartite graph occurs, even in a
seven-connected example which is already terminal through a `K_7` minor.
An exhaustive conditional contact theorem identifies a labelled
`K_7`-minus-one-edge model whenever the seven-column graph is abstractly
edge-maximal, but realizable exchange-maximality does not imply that abstract
hypothesis.

The focused next target in the bypass branch is therefore palette-to-column
alignment: use the all-edge, singleton and five-colour-lock responses on
`F` to construct the required labelled `K_5` model from the bilateral
palette contacts and the latent columns, or return an explicit `K_7` model,
a common boundary partition, an exact-seven
response, or a response-preserving proper nested same-form order-eight
continuation which strictly decreases the literal operated shore.  A
conflict component, a new colouring, or a contact rotation alone is not an acceptable
exit.  Universal saturation separately reduces to a named one-edge response
or a joint five-colour triad fan, whose palette paths are not yet assigned to
column labels.  The two-shore list dichotomy and incidence cycle remain
secondary until their colouring operation is aligned with this fixed response.
Genuinely split-terminal
`I,T` cuts remain a conditional fast route; the other small-shore and
odd-wheel alternatives remain separate.

A promoted
[near-full edge-component closure](results/hc7_order8_nearfull_edge_triangle_closure.md)
now settles the exact two-vertex small-shore case in the original aligned
three-component host whenever each endpoint misses at most one boundary
vertex.  Its written contraction argument handles every compatible
bipartition.  A separately checked finite theorem tests the actual `185`
compact boundary types and all `13,505` full/full, one-miss and ordered
distinct-two-miss profiles.  Exactly `258` two-miss profiles are
incompatible, and every one contains a boundary triangle away from the two
misses.  That triangle, the open-shore edge, the opposite full component
and the singleton `{u}` give an explicit seven-branch-set `K_7`-minor model.
Thus the whole displayed near-full edge subcase is terminal; no operation
provenance or abstract rooted-`K_4` selection is needed.

The separately audited
[defect-two rerooting closure](results/hc7_order8_defect2_edge_reroot_closure.md)
eliminates the remaining endpoint profiles without another census.  An
endpoint missing two boundary vertices has degree seven.  Rerooting there
moves the two misses into its anti-neighbourhood and exhibits two disjoint
connected subgraphs full to the new seven-vertex boundary, contradicting
the promoted singleton packing-one theorem.  Combined with the preceding
near-full theorem, this eliminates every aligned two-vertex exterior
component.

This still does not force either aligned component to have order two.  The
earlier
[near-full census](active/hc7_p2_nearfull_bipartition_census.md) remains a
reproducible diagnostic for a broader static `K_4`-minor-free universe, but
its `520` configurations are no longer the live obstruction in the exact
three-component host above.  The audited
[relative-seven quotient closure](active/hc7_relative7_planar_deficit_closure.md)
still closes all `48` sharp marker quotients, while no theorem sends every
other live residue to that family.  The checked
[three-colourful-set assessment](active/hc7_three_colourful_sets_route_assessment.md)
remains relevant only beyond the closed edge subcase.  The principal live
obligation is still minimum-boundary response coupling with exactly two
full components, followed by the other small-shore shapes.

Audited response theorems now strengthen the tight cases.  In degree eight,
the retained root `x` has nonempty opposite-shore leaf sets whose
union is an induced star.  Three of the four proper/monochromatic deletion
signatures are realized.  An inclusion-minimal aligned deletion response is
either one edge, which enters the existing clean-five-path or exact-seven
restart theorem, or a genuinely multi-edge obstruction in which every
deleted edge is forced monochromatic.  The multi-edge case is no longer
opaque: every one of its leaves has five aligned colour-indexed paths.
For each leaf these give either a strict generic exact-seven shore decrease
or a clean fan, and in all cases they reroute within the same exterior
component to a clean six-fan with six distinct boundary ends.  The rerouted
ends do not retain their colour labels, and fans from different leaves need
not be disjoint.

In either tight atomic case, one representative per trace is a maximum
independent set `I`, leaving five reserve vertices `R`.  One fixed colouring
of `G-u` simultaneously joins every pair of `R` in its two colour classes;
every boundary nonedge thereby has a literal path in one named shore.  After
deleting the colour class containing `I`, the remaining graph is
five-chromatic and `R` is rainbow in every five-colouring.  If the reserve
nonedge graph has at most six edges, this packet yields an `R`-rooted `K_5`.
If that model is confined to one shore, the other full shore, `I`, and
`{u}` complete an explicit `K_7` model.  More generally, failure even to
assemble a two-shore rooted `K_5` forces at least seven reserve nonedges to
be exclusively supported in one shore.  Any other maximum independent set
of order `d(u)-5` can replace `I` and generate a rotated packet with the
same conclusions.

Static reserve rotation is not a descent, as the audited
[rotation barrier](barriers/hc7_degree8_static_reserve_rotation_barrier.md)
shows, but it is no longer needed to treat the degree-eight concentration.
The audited
[concentrated-reserve elimination](results/hc7_low_degree_concentrated_reserve_elimination.md)
selects an independent reserve triple, a disjoint fixed-colouring connector,
and a carrier for that triple.  Proper-minor contractions force both the
merged and split complementary-pair responses on one shore; one matches a
response on the other shore and six-colours `G`.

This eliminates every concentration in both degrees eight and nine.  Nine
reserve nonedges are impossible; with eight the reserve is
`2K_2` disjoint-union `K_1`; with seven it is
`P_3` disjoint-union `K_2`.  In the latter two cases the connector/carrier
can avoid every nonexclusive demand.  Consequently the five-reserve
dichotomy always gives an `R`-rooted `K_5` in both tight atomic cases.  It
may still use both exterior components, so a connected remainder adjacent
to all five rooted bags and to `{u}` is not yet reserved as the seventh
branch set.

This is a genuine host-level compression, but not a terminal decoder.
The audited
[boundary-only fork barrier](barriers/hc7_common_root_boundary_only_fork_barrier.md)
is a connected order-nine boundary satisfying all compact boundary
conditions, with a singleton root component and even two crossing
shore-labelled matchings, whose four-edge augmentation is still
`K_4`-minor-free.  The remaining lemma now has only three shapes to close:
the degree-eight bilateral/atomic-three-trace case, the degree-nine bilateral
case, and the degree-nine crossed four-cycle carrying the rooted `K_4`.
It must use proper-minor colouring responses or literal bridge attachments
to finish the branch.  In degree eight the remaining issue is now the
simultaneous allocation of the separately clean, distinctly ended fans;
the one-colouring proof does not make different leaf-fans disjoint or keep
their rerouted endpoint colours.  In both tight atomic packets, the exact
obstruction is now an `R`-rooted `K_5` whose bags use both shores, leaving
no disjoint seventh bag; the concentrated alternative has been eliminated.
The immediate target is to choose that model while preserving an
`I`-connected seventh bag adjacent to `{u}` and all five rooted bags, or
make failure return a response-preserving separator of order at most nine
or a strict literal component descent.  A connectivity-only completion
would be open-problem strength and is not an acceptable substitute.
Further classification of the contracted boundary edge pattern cannot close
this branch.

The multi-rejected-trace alternative still needs a label-preserving
allocation of its simultaneous list-critical kernels or supported
nonedges.  The connected-exterior branch, including degree seven, still
uses the two-transition/tight-pole decoder above.  These are now the three
high-leverage residues; further finite local boundary taxonomy is not the
current strategy.

A gated marked-edge experiment has now been completed. The audited
[response-coupling theorem](results/hc7_marked_edge_response_coupling.md)
shows that deletion and contraction of one endpoint edge have identical
colouring responses. Simultaneously contracting the two anticomplete path
interiors gives one common six-colouring with a full five-colour split on at
least one interior, but the audited
[bilateral-exposure barrier](barriers/hc7_simultaneous_bipartite_bilateral_exposure_barrier.md)
shows that both interiors need not be blocked. A weighted marked-edge cut
does produce literal separators of order seven through nine with the deletion
operations on their correct shores, but it need not produce a separator
different from the original or expose an actual smaller component of
`G-N[u]`.  Component-uniform alignment repairs the response label only after
such a component is found, so the declared gate still blocks any
order-eight/nine or tight-pole taxonomy from this weighted cut alone.

The audited
[pole-star barrier](barriers/hc7_opposite_shore_shortest_transition_pole_barrier.md)
shows that exact-block attainability, every independent pole-star response,
shortest-transition minimality, seven-connectivity and the sharp order-eight
independence bound do not remove the tight pole residue.  Its host is not
asserted `K_7`-minor-free or fully minor-critical.  The next proof must
therefore use global minor exclusion or proper-minor colouring while
preserving the path or pole labels; more local transition taxonomy is not a
credible next step.

A gated return to the archived dominating-edge sink programme has also
completed its first cycle. The
[all-double-critical terminal-cycle theorem](results/hc7_double_critical_terminal_cycle_deletion_language.md)
gives an exact unbounded invariant: for each nonempty proper $S\subsetneq V(C)$,
`chi(G-S)=6` exactly when `S` is independent and `chi(G-S)=5` exactly when
`S` contains an edge. An even cycle has a fixed five-chromatic exterior
and one fixed dominating `K_5` model outside it. An odd cycle has either
the same outcome or a four-chromatic exterior with singleton-rooted
`K_5` models at each cycle vertex. Every cycle edge is a two-vertex
transversal of all six-cores, while those cores rotate so that no cycle
vertex is a common transversal.

This whole-cycle structure does not prove a six-residual successor.
Composing the exterior model with two cycle pieces, or aligning consecutive
singleton-rooted models, is the paired-rooted branch-set allocation problem
already open elsewhere. The
[equal-extremum frame barrier](barriers/hc7_six_residual_frame_selection_barrier.md)
also shows that minimum model order and shortest cycle length can select an
all-double-critical frame when an equally extremal frame has a
six-residual terminal edge. Its host deliberately has a `K_7` minor, so
it shows why global minor exclusion is indispensable rather than refuting
the full theorem. The closure gate failed and whole-sink classification
was not started.

## Standalone-results and publication status

The strongest coherent manuscript candidate is about necessary structure in
a hypothetical minor-minimal counterexample, rather than about completion of
the conjecture.  Its proposed core is:

- the
  [bounded full-separation entry](results/hc7_low_degree_adjacent_pair_alignment.md)
  of order seven to nine, including exact independent-block colour responses
  on both closed shores;
- the
  [component-uniform alignment](results/hc7_component_uniform_boundary_alignment.md),
  which assigns every component `D` of `G-N[u]` its own
  `z_D in N(D)` with `chi(G-{u,z_D})=6`;
- the proved
  [one/two/three exterior-component upper bounds](results/hc7_low_degree_exterior_component_bounds.md)
  in degrees seven, eight and nine;
- the
  [exact order-seven packing restrictions](results/hc7_exact_seven_packet_packing.md)
  for disjoint connected subgraphs adjacent to every boundary vertex; and
- the
  [component-deletion Kempe exchange](results/hc7_component_deletion_kempe_exchange.md)
  as the principal multi-component application.

The
[boundary-labelled degree-seven near-clique model](results/hc7_degree7_aligned_near_k7_model.md)
is a possible secondary application, subject to a particularly careful
overlap review against the public unlabelled near-`K_7` theorem.

This is a credible partial-results package, not a claim that `HC_7` is close
or that the listed results are novel in their present form.  The public
benchmark already includes Norin and Totschnig's theorem that every
non-six-colourable graph contains a
[$K_7^\vee$ minor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03244), where $K_7^\vee$ is
$K_7$ with two adjacent edges deleted.  The possible new contribution here
is the literal bounded-interface localization, component-uniform responses,
proved component bounds, packing restrictions, and retained labels—not the
unlabelled near-`K_7` guarantee itself.

Before submission, the package still needs a conventional literature and
priority review, independent human audits by graph-minor and
colouring/Kempe specialists, and independent reproduction of the
load-bearing finite classifications.  The extensive conditional
order-eight/order-nine case tree should not lead the manuscript.  The
[external-review and manuscript blueprint](active/hc7_partial_results_external_review_blueprint.md)
defines the frozen package, review questions, reproducibility inventory and
acceptance gate.  The earlier
[verification-gate report](active/hc7_verification_gate_report.md#partial-results-paper-blueprint-only-until-the-external-review-gates-pass)
records the internal go/no-go assessment; it is not external peer review.

## Headline audited advances

- **Bounded full interface.** Every hypothetical counterexample admits the
  order-`7`, `8`, or `9` full separation described above, with a
  four-colourable boundary and exact independent-block responses on both
  closed shores.
- **Component-uniform alignment.** At one low-degree vertex, every component
  outside the closed neighbourhood has its own boundary vertex `z_D` with
  `chi(G-{u,z_D})=6`.  Any actual smaller component is therefore a strict
  same-form restart without preserving the old boundary label.
- **Exterior-component upper bounds.** At degrees seven, eight and nine,
  the numbers of components outside the closed neighbourhood are at most
  one, two and three, respectively.  The degree-eight and degree-nine
  endpoints use retained, independently rerun finite boundary certificates.
- **Multi-component exchange.** With at least two exterior components, all
  component-supported nonedges can be retained simultaneously in one
  `K_6`-minor-free neighbourhood augmentation.  Either one trace is rejected
  by several components, or the unique rejector switches.  In the full
  singleton-rejection case there are exactly two components and the switch
  has one common root `x`, reducing singleton completion to an
  `N(x)`-meeting `K_6` model in the six-chromatic graph `G-x`.  Antipodal
  flip-cube symmetry now forces two rejector-changing coordinates at one
  boundary colouring and hence a common-trace or disjoint-path fork in one
  fixed extension.  Each changing coordinate now lies on a canonical
  alternating cycle of literal full two-colour components from two fixed
  shore extensions; boundary-edge augmentation alone is provably
  insufficient.
- **Two-transition opposite-shore geometry.** Audited pole normalization
  and a second exact-block transition give two vertex-disjoint paths in
  opposite open shores with disjoint boundary nonedges, unless the exact
  tight pole residue occurs.  A `K_6` minor after adding those two nonedges
  lifts to an explicit `K_7` model.  The surviving augmented boundary is
  therefore `K_6`-minor-free, and terminal decoding remains open.
- **Exact-seven packing.** In the hypothetical counterexample setup, the
  displayed inequalities orient every exact order-seven interface toward
  one shore with packing number one.
- **Unbounded cycle completion.** The
  [cycle-boundary theorem](results/hc7_cycle_boundary_completion.md) closes
  the induced-cycle family under its displayed universal adjacent pair,
  exactly two connected full shores, and `K_5`-minor-after-pair-deletion
  hypotheses, by an explicit `K_7` model or a planar gluing contradiction.
- **Boundary-labelled near-clique structure.** The
  [degree-seven aligned model theorem](results/hc7_degree7_aligned_near_k7_model.md)
  retains the literal boundary labels needed for branch-set surgery.
- **First-hit reductions.** Rado--gammoid and transfer results convert much
  of the palette-to-label problem into literal first-hit geometry, but the
  final response-coupling step remains open.
- **Atomic weak-immersion classification.** The
  [atomic rounding theorem](results/hc7_atomic_weak_k7_immersion_rounding.md)
  classifies a weak `K_7` immersion having exactly one binary collision.
  This frozen conditional direction and one exact two-bridge large
  one-star descendant are summarized in the
  [atomic frontier](active/hc7_atomic_weak_immersion_frontier.md).
  The common-end case gives an explicit `K_7` minor; every other case gives
  a spanning exact `K_7`-minus-one-edge model with singleton deficient
  roots.  In the disjoint-demand case it also retains a common frame with an
  octahedral residual quotient, and a collision vertex of degree at most
  nine exposes a bounded full interface.  The
  [icosahedral barrier example](barriers/hc7_atomic_weak_immersion_icosahedral_guardrail.md)
  shows sharply that collision avoidance can relocate the collision at
  equal potential, the deficient pairs need not identify the terminal pair,
  and the proposed paired linkage can fail.  The audited
  [octahedral-frame augmentation result](results/hc7_atomic_octahedral_frame_augmentation.md)
  proves that the exact quotient is `K_8-3K_2` and any one of its three
  absent adjacencies gives an explicit `K_7` model.  A clean missing-pair
  path and a noncofacial four-connected remainder also close, as do every
  nontrivial complete substitution and every monotone augmentation of the
  icosahedral example by at most seven vertices.  The audited
  [bridge normal form](results/hc7_atomic_h0_bridge_quadrant_normal_form.md)
  gives the exact 488-case classification for one added `T`-path and
  confines every whole `T`-bridge to one of four attachment regions.  In a
  seven-connected host, the residue with at most one internal subdivision
  vertex gives an explicit `K_7` model or an exact order-seven separator;
  under strong seven-contraction-criticality that separator has the named
  proper-minor responses.  It also proves that `K_{3,2,2,2}` cannot occur as
  a subgraph of a seven-connected `K_7`-minor-free host.  The audited
  [clean-root attachment theorem](results/hc7_atomic_h0_clean_three_arm_closure.md)
  now closes every connected collision-side piece whose attachments admit
  three disjoint arms from `e,f,g`; equivalently, every surviving component
  bridge has a Hall-deficient clean-support incidence graph.  In particular,
  one contact at the third clean root and two distinct ordered contacts on
  the opposite clean--clean segment are terminal.  The audited
  [exact-quotient forest theorem](results/hc7_atomic_exact_j_minimal_forest_landing.md)
  also closes a spanning common-frame contraction when every proper
  subforest quotient remains seven-connected: only the two universal fibres
  can be nontrivial, and the host has an explicit `K_7` model or an exact
  order-seven separator with the standard proper-minor responses.  Its
  [partial-contraction barrier](barriers/hc7_atomic_exact_j_partial_contraction_lift_barrier.md)
  proves why an earlier first loss cannot be lifted by connectivity alone:
  the quotient six-cut expands to a boundary of order `6+|F_0|`, unbounded
  in the original host.  The barrier family is itself six-colourable and has
  a displayed `K_7`, so it does not survive the full hypotheses.  The audited
  [attachment-hull theorem](results/hc7_partial_loss_attachment_hull.md)
  now extracts the exact literal information which does survive that lift:
  every lifted component's attachment set spans each forest fibre, so every
  fibre leaf is adjacent to every lifted component.  It gives one exact-block
  colouring response automatically and the reverse response when another
  component has comparable attachment sets.  With one induced bipartite fibre,
  the bad quotient is exactly six-chromatic and both fibre sides meet all five
  other colour classes.  The audited
  [one-tree attachment-set classification](results/hc7_partial_loss_attachment_set_classification.md)
  makes this residue exact.  The hull condition is precisely a common-leaf
  condition.  An inclusion-minimal attachment set either lies inside another
  component's attachment set, giving the second full shore, or belongs to an
  antichain of disconnected attachment sets with private internal contacts in
  both directions.  Boundary order seven is exactly the path-fibre case with
  the two leaves as the selected attachment set, when comparison is automatic.
  Three distinctly supported common leaves close by the clean-arm theorem;
  otherwise Hall deficiency remains.  A realization theorem produces arbitrary
  such antichains under seven-connectivity and first-loss minimality alone, but
  deliberately contains a `K_7`; hence the next inference must use `K_7`-free
  labelled geometry or contraction-critical colouring.  The
  [adjacent barrier](barriers/hc7_partial_loss_chromatic_lift_barriers.md)
  shows sharply that a chorded fibre defeats the naive colour lift and that
  arbitrarily many common contacts may still occupy only two clean-support
  classes.  The adjacent
  [shared-hub defect-rotation barrier](barriers/hc7_atomic_shared_hub_defect_rotation_barrier.md)
  is an exact finite obstruction to a different shortcut: moving a common
  connector/provenance vertex changes the three absent quotient pairs, but
  need not lift to another labelled strong immersion or decrease the global
  collision potential.  Its thirteen-vertex host is only three-connected and
  three-colourable.  The audited
  [seven-fan closure](results/hc7_atomic_shared_hub_seven_fan_closure.md)
  now proves that this exact labelled obstruction is terminal in every
  seven-connected supergraph, even with arbitrarily many added vertices.
  Five checked one-edge `K_7` certificates at each of two subdivision
  vertices saturate the possible fan endpoints, force two clean paths to the
  common hub, and yield an explicit `K_7` model by a first-intersection split.
  This reusable fan-saturation mechanism does not yet reduce an arbitrary
  dirty replacement path to that thirteen-vertex labelled subgraph.  The audited
  [two-apex exclusion](results/hc7_atomic_shared_hub_two_apex_exclusion.md)
  gives an independent unbounded restriction: deleting any two vertex or edge
  objects from the exact thirteen-vertex graph leaves a checked Kuratowski
  subdivision, so no subdivision of that graph occurs in any two-apex host.
  In particular, the standard `K_2`-joined planar guardrails cannot falsify the
  exact shared-hub extension; a counterexample must weaken its literal
  subdivision structure or leave the two-apex class.  The audited
  [arbitrary-subdivision first-hit theorem](results/hc7_atomic_subdivision_first_hit_boundary.md)
  now advances that less literal case.  The two marked first-hit regions are
  anticomplete, have at least seven attachments in complementary quadrants,
  and expose an actual order-seven separator at equality.  Contacts from both
  regions inside the common `fg` route give an explicit `K_7`, as does any
  single `T`-bridge joining the open `f`- and `g`-incident route stars.  Hence
  every surviving bridge is one-sided.  A missing branch-avoiding path returns
  a separator of order eight or nine; an existing path has a normalized trace
  meeting each elementary route interval in at most one connected subpath and
  first returns outside `T_fg`.  The remaining configuration is therefore a
  genuinely multi-bridge chain through intervening route intervals, not an
  arbitrary dirty path.  The audited
  [path-absence response theorem](results/hc7_atomic_path_absence_response_boundary.md)
  now upgrades the missing-path branch: an inclusion-minimal separator in
  the nine named vertices is full on both distinguished sides, has order
  seven, eight or nine and a four-colourable boundary, realizes every
  independent boundary set as an exact block on each closed shore, and
  retains a selected edge-deletion response.  It is a bounded response
  interface, but not yet a strict same-form descent.

  The adjacent
  [dirty two-bridge-chain barrier](barriers/hc7_atomic_dirty_two_bridge_chain_barrier.md)
  refutes the bare inference that two one-sided bridges composed through one
  route interval already give a `K_7` minor.  Its exact thirteen-vertex graph
  is three-connected and four-chromatic.  The strengthened audited finite
  theorem checks that deleting any two vertex-or-edge objects leaves a
  Kuratowski subdivision; consequently no subdivision of this graph occurs
  in any two-apex host, not only in the standard joined-planar guardrail.  The
  audited
  [exact-core seven-fan theorem](results/hc7_atomic_two_bridge_exact_core_seven_fan_closure.md)
  nevertheless closes that same unsplit core in every seven-connected host:
  five terminal endpoint certificates force clean fan paths to `e,x` and an
  explicit `K_7` model.  For an arbitrary subdivision, the same certificates
  confine every surviving first hit to the subdivision of the eight-vertex
  graph with edges

  \[
   qa,qg,qs,ar,rs,sc,ae,ax,ce,cg,cx,eg.
  \]

  The audited
  [landing-star theorem](results/hc7_atomic_two_bridge_subdivision_landing_stars.md)
  now closes much of that route skeleton without requiring disjoint exterior
  paths.  If the common first-hit component meets both the open subdivided
  stars at `e` and `x`, their possibly intersecting paths belong to one branch
  set and give an explicit `K_7` model.  Thus a `K_7`-minor-free survivor
  avoids one entire open star.  In a hypothetical minor-minimal counterexample,
  a minimum `q`--`b` separator contained in the first-hit boundary either has
  order seven to nine and carries the full audited exact-block and selected-edge
  responses, or every such literal separator has order at least ten.

  The adjacent
  [forced-hub transit-label barrier](barriers/hc7_atomic_two_safe_transit_label_barrier.md)
  closes off the most direct small-boundary continuation: among all eleven
  retained labels in the exact core, only `p` can be absorbed into the
  prescribed `q,x` branch set while the other clean connection is retained.
  Hence there are not two distinct safe labels under that ownership rule.
  The exact remaining gate in this two-bridge descendant is therefore an
  unbounded large-boundary one-star-avoidance configuration.  Closing it
  requires a label-preserving
  dirty-path/bridge-composition theorem that either reroutes into the avoided
  star, produces a response boundary, or gives strict component descent;
  further finite local enumeration does not address that inference.  The earlier
  [six-connected multipartite barrier](barriers/hc7_atomic_h0_multipartite_bridge_guardrail.md)
  shows that individually two-apex bridge certificates need not share an
  apex pair and that normalized dominating `K_5` models may regenerate
  after every two-vertex deletion without yielding the needed exchange.
  The wider remaining inference is still the interaction of dirty replacement
  paths and Hall-deficient high-attachment quadrant bridges with the first bad
  partial quotient, retaining named ownership throughout.

## Exact trust boundary

- Exact attainment of every independent boundary block is separate on the
  two shores; it does not synchronize the rest of either colouring.
- Component-uniform alignment regenerates the named response at every actual
  anti-neighbourhood component.  Component deletion now couples all literal
  components at the common neighbourhood, but its common-trace kernels and
  its special common-root rooted-`K_6` residue are not terminal.  The
  common-root flip-cube theorem synchronizes two moves in one accepted
  extension, and affine switch-space incompatibility closes each changing
  coordinate into a literal alternating trace cycle.  The explicit
  compact-boundary barrier rules out closure from the resulting added edges
  alone, and the cycle is not yet a branch-set allocation.  None of these
  theorems addresses the
  connected-exterior tight pole residue.
- The two-transition theorem now gives vertex-disjoint paths in opposite
  open shores with disjoint boundary endpoints.  They may arise from
  different colouring operations, and when `G[S]+e+f` is `K_6`-minor-free
  their existence alone does not give a terminal model, common partition or
  strict restart.
- The tight pole residue survives all local exact-block and pole-star
  response axioms in an audited seven-connected seven-chromatic barrier.
  That barrier lacks global `K_7`-minor exclusion and full proper-minor
  six-colourability, so it does not refute the live theorem.
- A colour name is not a branch-set label. Any claimed minor construction
  must use literal first-hit vertices or another explicit label-preserving
  lift.
- The detailed order-eight and order-nine results are conditional
  refinements. They do not form an exhaustive fine-grained case chain for
  every original low-degree entry.
- The pentagonal-bipyramid theorems close several unbounded families, not
  all compatible cyclic-order expansions.
- The minimum-degree weak-immersion theorem does not force an atomic
  immersion or a collision vertex of degree at most nine.
  Contact-preserving singletonization also shows that the missed-bag
  paired-linkage formulation requires a new label-preserving ownership
  theorem.  The octahedral-frame and bridge refinements classify one path,
  confine each whole bridge, close the one-internal-vertex residue and
  exclude the multipartite saturation at seven-connectivity.  They do not
  yet combine arbitrary high-attachment quadrant bridges while retaining
  an `xe`, `ab`, or `cd` ownership augmentation, or return a strictly
  smaller full component with its named proper-minor response.  A saturating
  clean-root attachment matching is now terminal, but Hall deficiency alone
  has not been decoded.  Likewise the exact-`J` all-subsets forest landing is
  closed, but an earlier partial connectivity loss can have an unbounded
  literal lift and needs bridge ownership or chromatic response to control
  it.  Its attachment sets nevertheless span every contracted fibre tree and
  share all fibre leaves.  In the one-tree case, an inclusion-minimal set is
  either contained in another attachment set or sits in an antichain of
  disconnected sets with two-way private internal contacts; no stronger
  interval or comparison conclusion follows from connectivity and first-loss
  minimality alone.  This supplies only one closed-shore response unless a
  second component is literally full to the same boundary, and common leaves
  need not have three distinct clean-root supports.  The induced-bipartite
  one-fibre case has a stronger six-colour contact condition, but its
  label-preserving conversion remains open.  Bare reassignment of a shared
  connector/provenance vertex also fails:
  the rotated near-clique quotient need not have a labelled strong-immersion
  lift or improve the lexicographic collision potential.  The exact sparse
  example is nevertheless excluded from every seven-connected `K_7`-minor-free
  host by the new fan-saturation theorem, and no subdivision of it occurs in a
  two-apex host.  In an arbitrary subdivision, the first-hit theorem closes
  two-sided `fg` contacts and every single bridge spanning the two clean route
  stars.  The path-absence alternative now carries complete separate
  exact-block responses and a selected edge-deletion response, although it
  need not synchronize the shore colourings or give strict descent.  In the
  existing-path alternative, the exact two-bridge core closes at
  seven-connectivity and every surviving first hit is confined to the displayed
  eight-vertex skeleton.  A common first-hit component meeting both complete
  landing stars now gives an explicit model even when its two paths intersect.
  A minimum-cardinality contained `q`--`b` separator carries the full response
  when its order is at most nine; otherwise every such literal separator has
  order at least ten and the boundary avoids one whole open star.  The
  one-label forced-hub census
  supplies only `p`, so the proposed two-label shortcut cannot close it.  The
  order-ten assertion concerns separators contained in `Omega_q`; it is not a
  global ten-path linkage statement.  The
  six-connected barrier also rules out intersecting individual two-apex
  certificates or invoking bare dominating-model regeneration.  The
  single-collision gate therefore remains open, and this route does not
  replace the primary bounded-interface obligation.
- Internal audits establish the repository's current trust status; they are
  not external peer review.
