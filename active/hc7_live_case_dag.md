# Frozen verification map for the direct `HC_7` programme

**Status:** point-in-time verification map for the frozen direct-`HC_7`
programme, not a current status authority or a new theorem.  Terms such as
“live” and “currently” below describe that historical programme.  Every
mathematical arrow below is either linked to an audited result or marked open.  This file makes
the exhaustiveness and descent obligations explicit; it does not prove
`HC_7`.

## 1. Conventions

- A **terminal** arrow constructs a `K_7`-minor model or one boundary
  equality partition realized by both closed shores, and therefore
  contradicts the hypothetical counterexample.
- A **strict recursive** arrow returns to the same stated class in the same
  host graph while decreasing a named quantity measured on literal vertices
  of the host graph.
- A **fresh response** arrow returns a valid colouring obstruction but does
  not preserve enough data, or does not prove a decrease, to be used as an
  induction step.
- A finite classification is never treated as an unbounded arrow unless an
  audited reduction places every instance in that finite class.

## 2. The exhaustive all-degree chain

Let `G` be a minor-minimal counterexample to `HC_7`.  The audited
[low-degree adjacent-pair theorem](../results/hc7_low_degree_adjacent_pair_alignment.md)
gives a vertex `u` of degree seven through nine and a bounded full
separation at every component of `G-N[u]`.  The audited
[component-uniform alignment theorem](../results/hc7_component_uniform_boundary_alignment.md)
gives, for every such component `C`, a vertex `z_C in S=N_G(C)` such that

\[
 7\le d_G(u)\le9,
 \qquad 7\le |S|\le d_G(u),
 \qquad \chi(G-\{u,z_C\})=6.
\]

The graphs `G[C\cup S]` and `G-C` form an actual separation.  The connected
subgraph `C` and the singleton `{u}` are each adjacent to every vertex of
`S`; `G[S]` is four-colourable; both closed shores realize every nonempty
independent set of `G[S]` as an exact boundary colour class; and the edge
deletion `G-uz` supplies a named response rejected by the intact opposite
shore.

The split-boundary terminal is proved in
[`hc7_split_boundary_synchronization.md`](../results/hc7_split_boundary_synchronization.md).
The displayed cycle family is closed by the
[cycle-boundary completion theorem](../results/hc7_cycle_boundary_completion.md)
and its bounded-interface applications.  In all cases, the
[exact-block Kempe reduction](../results/hc7_bounded_interface_exact_block_kempe_reduction.md)
returns literal failed-lift paths with bounded boundary-contact defect.  The
audited
[last-pole normal form](../results/hc7_bounded_interface_pole_move_normal_form.md)
makes a final response pole-free unless it has one exact five-block/six-block
form.  The audited
[two-transition theorem](../results/hc7_bounded_interface_two_transition_disjoint_response.md)
uses the endpoint nonedge of a first `C`-path as the exact block for a second
transition.  It produces vertex-disjoint paths in opposite open shores with
disjoint boundary nonedges, or the tight pole residue.  In the path case a
`K_6` minor in the boundary augmented by those two nonedges lifts to an
explicit `K_7` model, so the surviving augmented boundary is necessarily
`K_6`-minor-free.

In the multi-component branch, the audited sharp bounds leave at most two
components in degree eight and at most three in degree nine.  Component
deletion puts all their private rejection colourings in one connected Kempe
space and retains one supported nonedge through every component at once.
The full singleton-rejection outcome has exactly two components and one
common recolouring root `x`.  Antipodal symmetry of its two-colour flip cube
now forces two rejector-changing coordinates at one boundary colouring.  In
one fixed accepted extension this gives either a common full two-colour trace
or two disjoint paths, together with an opposite-component path and an
induced crossing odd cycle through `x`.  Affine incompatibility of two fixed
shore extensions further forces every changing coordinate onto an alternating
cycle of literal full two-colour components.  A compact order-nine barrier shows
that even the stronger four-edge crossing augmentation can remain
`K_4`-minor-free, so literal path interiors cannot be discarded.  Singleton
completion still requires an `N(x)`-meeting `K_6` model in `G-x` or another
terminal outcome.  A lower boundary is not a strict arrow unless the literal
component also decreases, and the common-trace and common-root outcomes
remain open inputs to `M`.

In the connected branch, the two paths need not arise from one colouring
operation, and neither the `K_6`-minor-free augmented-boundary case nor the
tight pole case is terminal.
The audited
[pole-star barrier](../barriers/hc7_opposite_shore_shortest_transition_pole_barrier.md)
shows that local exact-block responses, all pole-star deletions,
shortest-transition minimality and seven-connectivity do not eliminate the
second case.  It lacks global `K_7`-minor exclusion and full proper-minor
criticality, which are therefore the remaining available host-level inputs.

The dashed arrows are precisely the open
[pole-free bridge composition theorem](hc7_bounded_interface_synchronization_frontier.md#4-primary-open-theorem).
Its third outcome must return an actual component `D` with `|D|<|C|`.
Component-uniform alignment then supplies a new named edge `uz_D`; the old
boundary vertex need not be preserved.  Selecting `C` initially with maximum
order isolates the nonrecursive path case to components tied with `C` in
order and the at most two vertices of `N(u)-S`.  A terminal singleton
component is impossible.  Consequently this one open theorem, together
with the audited entry, would prove `HC_7`.

This is the only currently justified exhaustive case DAG for all three
possible degrees.  It is important not to replace it by the more detailed
order-eight or order-nine diagrams below: those are conditional descendants,
not exhaustive entry theorems for arbitrary original degree-eight or
degree-nine vertices.

## 3. Degree-seven refinement

When `d_G(u)=7`, necessarily `S=N(u)` and `G-N[u]` is one connected
component.  The audited degree-seven machinery produces a boundary-labelled
model of `K_7` with one missing adjacency or two adjacent missing
adjacencies.  Failed model repairs produce actual full-neighbourhood
separations.  Whenever an actual order-seven separation has a selected
crossing-edge deletion response, the
[generic exact-seven restart theorem](../results/hc7_generic_exact7_response_restart.md)
gives exactly four outcomes.

  S1["Singleton shore"]
  SD["Strict exact-seven restart"]
  PE["Proper list-critical core with boundary at least 8"]
  SF["Shore-filling two-root list-critical core"]
  MN["Minimum positive-excess boundary X"]

  FC["Exactly two or three components, each full to X"]

  X --> PE --> MN
  MN -->|"some component has neighbourhood 7"| FR
  FR -->|"valid response, but no proved decrease"| X
  MN -->|"otherwise"| FC --> TM
  X --> SF --> TM
```

The minimum positive-excess normal form is the audited theorem
[`hc7_minimum_positive_separator_normal_form.md`](../results/hc7_minimum_positive_separator_normal_form.md).
Its exact-seven return is a **fresh response**, not a strict recursive
arrow: the theorem expressly does not prove that the returned shore is
smaller than the previously selected shore.  This is the principal cycle
in the fine-grained programme.

The three presently open terminal modes are:

1. a singleton operated shore, whose surviving opposite exterior is
   nonbipartite and two-connected after the proved bridge and cutvertex
   reductions;
2. a proper core whose minimum positive-excess boundary has two or three
   boundary-full complementary components; and
3. a shore-filling positive-excess list-critical core.  The all-tight
   multiblock subfamily of the third mode is closed, but positive total
   list-degree excess remains unbounded.

The exact target for these modes is stated in the
[degree-seven technical frontier](hc7_degree7_model_separator_frontier.md#generic-exact-seven-restart-and-the-remaining-terminal-theorem).
It must construct an explicit `K_7`-minor model, return an exact order-seven
separation with one common complete boundary equality partition, or return
a strictly smaller generic exact-seven interface.

## 4. Where the order-eight and order-nine results attach

The developed order-eight and order-nine theorems attach only after the
proper-core positive-excess branch above has supplied additional selected
responses and full-component structure.

| Developed branch | Required entry data | What is proved | What is not proved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum positive-excess boundary | A proper exact-seven list-critical core and a minimum eligible boundary of order at least eight | Either a fresh exact-seven response, or exactly two or three complementary components full to the boundary | A strict return to the former exact-seven shore; a common boundary partition |
| Order-eight component analysis | The selected response, a full order-eight boundary, and the relevant component/label hypotheses | Many path, cutvertex, two-cut, and labelled subfamilies terminate or descend | That every original degree-eight entry reaches one of these subfamilies |
| Order-nine spanning list-critical endpoint | A two-full-shore positive-excess descendant, a fixed exact block, a shortest transition, and exclusion of proper list-critical kernels | Boundaries of order at least ten reduce; the surviving paired-kernel boundary has order nine; its colouring transition has a short normal form | That every original degree-nine entry reaches this endpoint; a host-level terminal or strict labelled descent |

In particular, there is no proved arrow

```text
arbitrary low-degree entry with d(u)=8 or 9
    -> developed order-eight or order-nine positive-excess endpoint.
```

The [large-boundary singleton-response theorem](../results/hc7_large_boundary_singleton_response_descent.md)
also needs a scope qualification.  A proper list-critical kernel returns a
smaller connected response side, but with an uncontrolled boundary, a fresh
trace and no preserved minor-model labels.  That is useful host-level
compression, not by itself a recursive arrow in the labelled programme.

## 5. Arrow ledger

| Arrow | Preserved literal data | Rank | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypothetical counterexample to low-degree interface | Fixed host `G`; `u,C,S`; actual separation; two boundary-full connected subgraphs; a component-specific edge-deletion response `uz_C` for every `C` | none needed | proved and audited |
| Low-degree entry to sharp exterior-component counts | Fixed host and literal components of `G-N[u]` | none needed | proved and audited: at most one, two, three for degrees seven, eight, nine |
| At least two components to component-deletion exchange | Common neighbourhood; one private rejected colouring and one supported nonedge for every literal component | none needed | proved and audited; full simultaneous augmentation is `K_6`-minor-free |
| Singleton rejection with full components to common-root residue | Exactly two literal full components; one recolouring root `x`; `chi(G-x)=6`; an induced crossing cycle; two rejector-changing coordinates synchronized in one accepted extension | terminal rooted completion still required | proved and audited fork; each changing coordinate lies on a coherent alternating cycle of fixed-shore full components, while boundary-edge-only closure is refuted |
| Split boundary to common partition | Literal boundary and both extension languages | terminal | proved and audited |
| Cycle-boundary family to `K_7` | Two universal vertices, induced cycle, connected full shores | terminal | proved and audited |
| Exact-block transition to failed-lift path | Boundary root, selected edge deletion, exact block, literal path and first hits | none | proved and audited |
| Last pole move to a pole-free path or the tight pole residue | Exact final trace, moved vertex, merged independent block, operation colours and all final opposite-shore extensions | none | proved and audited |
| Two exact-block transitions to disjoint opposite-shore paths or the tight pole residue | Literal boundary nonedges, paths and shore ownership; operation provenance remains separate | none | proved and audited; the path survivor has `K_6 not minor G[S]+e+f` |
| Disjoint paths or tight pole to global conclusion | Must preserve the displayed path or pole labels and return an actual anti-neighbourhood component; its response is regenerated component-locally | required decrease `|C'|<|C|` in recursive outcome | **open; relative to the entry reduction this is `HC_7`-strength** |
| Exact-seven proper core with boundary seven to restart | Fixed host, new literal seven-boundary, selected crossing edge and one operation-specific colouring | smaller connected operated shore | proved and audited |
| Minimum positive-excess boundary to exact-seven response | Fixed host and a fresh selected response | no decrease proved | proved response; **not** an induction arrow |
| Minimum positive-excess boundary to two/three full components | Fixed host, literal minimum boundary, operation-specific exclusive responses | minimum boundary is a normalization, not a recursive rank | proved and audited normal form; terminal coupling open |
| Proper kernel in the order-nine paired branch to a fresh response side | Fixed host and a new obstruction colouring | smaller connected set, but boundary and labels uncontrolled | proved compression; **not** an allowed labelled recursion |

## 6. Verification conclusion

The repository contains substantial unbounded reductions and several
complete infinite-family closures.  It does not yet contain a well-founded
fine-grained induction covering all live branches.  There are two honest
ways to state the remaining frontier:

1. globally, prove the pole-free bridge composition theorem, which is
   sufficient for `HC_7` relative to the audited entry reduction; or
2. in the degree-seven refinement, prove a host-level response-coupling
   theorem that simultaneously closes the singleton, positive-excess and
   shore-filling modes and makes every nonterminal exact-seven return
   strictly smaller.

The second target is narrower in hypotheses and a better laboratory for a
new mechanism.  The first target is the exhaustive global obligation and
must remain visible when assessing whether the programme is converging.
